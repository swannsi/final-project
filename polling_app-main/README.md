# polling_app

1) First we need python>= 3.7, and Django version >=3.1 (we find it with `python -m django --version`)
2) we run `python manage.py migrate` to create the polls model
3) create admin with `python manage.py createsuperuser`
3) Start the development server with `python manage.py runserver`and visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ to create a poll (you'll need the Admin app enabled).
